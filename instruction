Guidelines:

1. Outlining your methodology for solving the problem:
I took the subsequent actions:
1.1. I opened Visual Studio 2019 and started a new project.
1.2. Comprehending the Needs:
1.3. Take the article text and extract it from the URLs in Input.xlsx.
1.4. Use text analysis to calculate the variables that are given.
1.5. Store the results in the Output Data Structure.xlsx structure.


2. Context and Requirements:
2.1. Verify that the required Python libraries, such as Pandas for data management and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, are installed.
2.2.Extraction of Data:
input: Input.xlsx, which includes links.
Results: separate text files with the article's title and text that are named with the URL_ID.


3. Textual Examination:
3.1. Determine different text metrics, like polarity, positive, and negative scores.
3.2. Output: An Output Data Structure.xlsx-compliant CSV file.




4. How to use the.py file to produce results
4.1. Using the command "pip install -m requirements.txt" on your local computer or virtual machine, you must first install all dependencies that are contained in the requirements.txt file.
4.2.If your local system or virtual machine is a virtual machine, you must activate the environment after installing all requirements; if not, there is no need to activate.
4.3. You must execute the command "python index.py" on a Windows computer or "python3 index.py" in a terminal on a Mac or Linux device after activating the environment.
4.5. In case you don't understand, I'll provide you with two files: index.py file and index.ipynb file.

Note: Regardless of whether Python supports that version or not, make sure you have installed all dependencies on your system. These dependencies can be used to launch Python 3.12.0.
